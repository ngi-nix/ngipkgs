            To test, first create a directory with a subdirectory named `.ethersync` and
            run `ethersync daemon`, wait a few seconds it will print URLs that can be used
            to connect to this server.
          '';
          screenshot = "server-ready.png";
        }
        {
          instruction = ''
            Then, create another directory with a subdirectory named `.ethersync` and run
            `ethersync daemon --peer <URL>`, the two directories are now connected.
          '';
          screenshot = "server-ready.png";
        }
        {
          instruction = ''
            Now you can edit files in one directory and the changes will be synchronized
            in the other.  If you use Neovim, the instance in this shell has also been
            configured with the Ethersync plugin, so you can try using :EthersyncInfo and
            :EthersyncJumpToCursor.
