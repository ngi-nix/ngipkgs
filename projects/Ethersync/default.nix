      Ethersync enables real-time collaborative editing of local text files.

      To test, first create a directory with a subdirectory named `.ethersync` and
      run `ethersync share`, wait a few seconds it will print the secret key
      that can be used to connect to this server.

      Next, create another directory with a subdirectory named `.ethersync`,
      run `echo peer="<secret-key>" >.ethersync/config`, then `ethersync join`.
      The two directories are now connected.

      You can now edit files in one directory and the changes will be synchronized
      in the other.  If you use Neovim, the instance in this shell has also been
      configured with the Ethersync plugin, so you can try using :EthersyncInfo and
      :EthersyncJumpToCursor.
