      A demo VM for testing Galène.

      To use Galène, you have to set up a group, and permissions & users within this group.
      For full details, take a look at: ${links.test.url}#group-definitions

      After Galène has finished starting up, the on-screen text in the VM will inform you about the exact directory
      that your group configs need to be put into.

      An example config is available within the VM under `/etc/galene-test-config.json`. If you copy this file to
      the group directory and name it `test.json`, then a group named `test` will be available in the web interface
      for you to use.

      A known issue with specifically this demo is that WebRTC doesn't seem to be working: You can join the group and
      get familiar with the interface, but audio and video is unlikely to work. Installing Galène properly on a local
      system will get rid of this issue.
