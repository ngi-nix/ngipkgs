      Libervia is a multi-frontend, multi-purpose XMPP client. It doesn't just
      focus on instant messaging, and uses the open standard to provide features
      such as blogging/microblogging, calendar events, file sharing, end-to-end
      encryption, etc.

            Once the graphical desktop has loaded, navigate to and click:

            Give the client some time to load.

            Once it has fully loaded, you need to create a new profile and enter some details. Use whichever name you want.

            - If you have an existing XMPP account, enter your JID and password
            - If you don't already have an XMPP account and just want to test the client, a local XMPP server has been
              set up with the following user:
              - JID: alice@example.org
              - Password: foobar
          '';
        }
        {
          instruction = ''
            Once the profile is created, select it in the list and click on "Connect".
          '';
        }
        {
          instruction = ''
            You can now try out Libervia's Kivy desktop client.

        }
        {
          instruction = ''
            For testing communication between two users, you may repeat the process for adding a profile, and use the
            following credentials:

            - JID: bob@example.org
            - Password: foobar
          '';
        }
      ];
    };
  };
}
