      Once the graphical environment is running, open Kaidan from Menu > Network.

      Right-click on its entry on the window bar and choose "Maximize Alt+f10" to fit the Kaidan window to the screen size.

      NOTE: You need an XMPP user account to use Kaidan.
      If you have an account, use that to login and you should be able to send/receive a message.

      If you don't have one, two demo-user accounts, `alice` and `john`, are available.

      Login as the first user:
      - Chat address: `john@example.org`
      - Password: `foobar`

      When logged in, choose "add contact by chat address" on the hamburger menu.
      Add `alice@example.com`, and a chat will be started. Send a message to `alice`.

      You can verify that `alice` has received the message by logging out `john` and logging in as `alice`
      - Chat address: `alice@example.org`
      - Password: `foobar`
    '';
  };
}
