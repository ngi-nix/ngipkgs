# How to reuse?

Here, to reuse mean either:
- to add (eg. to append, to prepend, to insert),
- to remove,
- or to modify (eg. to update, to override, to alter).
something than cannot (or should not) be directly changed where it's defined,
yet is significant enough (eg. in size or authority)
to be reused instead of redefined.
