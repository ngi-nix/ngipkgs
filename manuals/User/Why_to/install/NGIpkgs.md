# Why to install NGIpkgs?

This is what you can do with NGIpkgs:

- Run locally programs provided by NGIpkgs,
  on [any platform supporting an implementation of Nix](#User_How_to_install_Nix)
  This does not require using the NixOS Linux distribution at all.

- Develop you own software using libraries or tools
  provided by NGIpkgs.

- Deploy `systemd` (resp. `launchd`) services provided by NGIpkgs,
  to hosts running [NixOS](https://nixos.org)
  (resp. [nix-darwin](https://github.com/nix-darwin/nix-darwin)).
