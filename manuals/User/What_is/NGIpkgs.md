# What is NGIpkgs?

The [NGIpkgs repository](https://github.com/ngi-nix/ngipkgs)
provides:
- packages (`pkgs`) recipes
in [Nix-the-language](https://nix.dev/tutorials/nix-language.html)
to install software and all their dependencies using [a Nix-package-manager](#User_How_to_install_Nix)
(mainly [`nix`](https://nix.dev/manual/nix));

- `services` recipes
in [Nix-the-language](https://nix.dev/tutorials/nix-language.html)
to use those software inside a Nix configuration management framework
(mainly [NixOS](https://nixos.org));

- examples and tests of those services recipes.

The Nix recipes maintained or being developed into NGIpkgs
are for software funded by the [Next Generation Internet](https://www.ngi.eu) (NGI) initiative
of the [European Commission](https://commission.europa.eu)
through the [NLnet Foundation](https://nlnet.nl/).
