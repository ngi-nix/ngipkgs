### Instructions

<!-- Replace `PROJECT_ISSUE_NUMBER` with the issue number that contains the project's triaged information.
If one doesn't exist, create it by following the instructions in the [contributor documentation](https://github.com/ngi-nix/ngipkgs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#triaging-an-ngi-application). -->

Use metadata about the application from its tracking issue:

- #PROJECT_ISSUE_NUMBER

and implement a NixOS VM test for the example.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The test needs to validate the basic functionality of the example configuration.
> - For an example of how this looks like, please refer to the [project template](https://github.com/ngi-nix/ngipkgs/tree/main/maintainers/templates/project).
